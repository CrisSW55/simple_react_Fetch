# Using the simple react framework to fetch real data and display on local server screen!
<!-- Today, I watched react playlist tutorial, then  I applied the react fundamentals used in the videos. The two react hooks,  the useState() and useEffect() make rendering easier on the DOM. The useState() renders current state of the screen, the state shows up in the react component or html element. The useEffect() uses external system, grabbing the data from the url and applies it into the project. For example, using the fetch() function takes the URL and grabs the data as a response converted to json, using json() function. Then, the data gets placed into the useState(), so it may become displayed in the screen. After that, the react component or html element will show the useState's value, in this case the data fetched. Using the another react state hook the isLoading state can be used while waiting for the data to display. The logic condition AND can be placed before the react component or html element, so if true the element or component will show only. Remeber to use {} brackets to write in javascript code, such as the && logic on the component or element. These are valuable learning lessons, which allow me to grasp ReactJS or React fundamentals. -->
